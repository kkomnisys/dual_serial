/*
Each group of #define lines below corresponds to one of the
settings in the Tools > USB Type menu.  This file defines what
type of USB device is actually created for each of those menu
options.

Each "interface" is a set of functionality your PC or Mac will
use and treat as if it is a unique device.  Within each interface,
the "endpoints" are the actual communication channels.  Most
interfaces use 1, 2 or 3 endpoints.  By editing only this file,
you can customize the USB Types to be any collection of interfaces.

To modify a USB Type, delete the XYZ_INTERFACE lines for any
interfaces you wish to remove, and copy them from another USB Type
for any you want to add.

Give each interface a unique number, and edit NUM_INTERFACE to
reflect the total number of interfaces.

Next, assign unique endpoint numbers to all the endpoints across
all the interfaces your device has.  You can reuse an endpoint
number for transmit and receive, but the same endpoint number must
not be used twice to transmit, or twice to receive.

Most endpoints also require their maximum size, and some also
need an interval specification (the number of milliseconds the
PC will check for data from that endpoint).  For existing
interfaces, usually these other settings should not be changed.

Edit NUM_ENDPOINTS to be at least the largest endpoint number used.

Edit NUM_USB_BUFFERS to control how much memory the USB stack will
allocate.  At least 2 should be used for each endpoint.  More
memory will allow higher throughput for user programs that have
high latency (eg, spending time doing things other than interacting
with the USB).

Edit the ENDPOINT*_CONFIG lines so each endpoint is configured
the proper way (transmit, receive, or both).

If you are using existing interfaces (making your own device with
a different set of interfaces) the code in all other files should
automatically adapt to the new endpoints you specify here.

If you need to create a new type of interface, you'll need to write
the code which sends and receives packets, and presents an API to
the user.  Usually, a pair of files are added for the actual code,
and code is also added in usb_dev.c for any control transfers,
interrupt-level code, or other very low-level stuff not possible
from the packet send/receive functons.  Code also is added in
usb_inst.c to create an instance of your C++ object.  This message
gives a quick summary of things you will need to know:
https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/49045?p=164512&viewfull=1#post164512

You may edit the Vendor and Product ID numbers, and strings.  If
the numbers are changed, Teensyduino may not be able to automatically
find and reboot your board when you click the Upload button in
the Arduino IDE.  You will need to press the Program button on
Teensy to initiate programming.

Some operating systems, especially Windows, may cache USB device
info.  Changes to the device name may not update on the same
computer unless the vendor or product ID numbers change, or the
"bcdDevice" revision code is increased.

If these instructions are missing steps or could be improved, please
let me know?  http://forum.pjrc.com/forums/4-Suggestions-amp-Bug-Reports
